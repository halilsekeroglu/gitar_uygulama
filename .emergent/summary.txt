The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the development of a Guitar Fretboard Chord Recognition Application. The process began with clarifying user requirements for chord complexity, sound features, and design. Following the established development workflow, a responsive frontend was first built with mock data, quickly demonstrating core UI functionality. An initial hurdle with  export was promptly identified via logs and fixed, enabling successful UI rendering. After user approval, the backend was developed, including a  file for seamless integration, new data models, and the core chord recognition logic. Frontend integration with these new APIs was performed, and residual mock data references were removed. The backend was thoroughly tested and passed. The current state is poised for automated frontend testing, which the user has just approved.

The goal is a mobile-compatible web application that identifies guitar chords from user-selected notes on a 6-string, 24-fret fretboard. Key features include clickable frets for note selection, calculation of selected notes, and sophisticated chord recognition (basic and advanced, including major, minor, 7ths, suspended, added, diminished, augmented). The application must display the recognized chords and alternative interpretations. The user interface is in Turkish, with a simple, responsive, and guitar-themed design (wood tones, amber-gold). An optional feature includes MIDI sound playback when frets are clicked, with an accompanying toggle button. The application targets guitar students, teachers, music theory learners, and composers, aiming to provide a functional MVP.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main React application entry, managing routing and orchestrating primary component rendering.
    -   **Changes**: Initially lacked , causing a loading error. This was fixed. It was updated to integrate the  component and coordinate data flow with the backend.
-   ** & **:
    -   **Importance**: Global styling and Tailwind CSS imports.
    -   **Changes**: No explicit changes mentioned, but they form the foundation for the application's visual theme.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Configures Tailwind CSS for custom colors and design tokens, essential for applying the guitar-themed aesthetic.
    -   **Changes**: No explicit changes mentioned, but implicitly configured for the guitar-themed design.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The core UI component rendering the interactive guitar fretboard. Handles user clicks, displays selected notes, and shows chord recognition results.
    -   **Changes**: Created to implement the 24-fret, 6-string UI. Initially used mock data for chord recognition and MIDI sound. Later modified to consume data from the FastAPI backend for real-time chord recognition.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Contains utility functions aiding , such as mapping fret positions to musical notes and managing fretboard state logic.
    -   **Changes**: Created to encapsulate reusable fretboard-related logic.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Custom CSS file for specific styles not managed by Tailwind, particularly for the guitar-themed design.
    -   **Changes**: Created to implement the guitar-themed design (e.g., wood textures, amber-gold highlights).
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main FastAPI application, managing API endpoints and integrating with business logic.
    -   **Changes**: Extended from initial setup to include new routes for chord recognition and other necessary backend functionalities, importing models and chord logic.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines Pydantic models for data validation and MongoDB document schemas (e.g., for notes, chords, or potential user/session data).
    -   **Changes**: Created to structure data for the chord recognition feature.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Implements the core music theory algorithm to analyze note inputs and identify basic and advanced chords.
    -   **Changes**: Created to house the primary business logic for chord identification.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Contains automated tests for the backend API endpoints and business logic.
    -   **Changes**: Created to ensure the backend's functionality and reliability.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: A documentation file outlining the API contracts, mock data replacement strategy, backend implementation plan, and frontend/backend integration details.
    -   **Changes**: Created to guide the full-stack development and integration process.

<current_work>
The Guitar Fretboard Chord Recognition Application has reached a significant milestone. The frontend, designed with a guitar-themed aesthetic (wood tones, amber-gold highlights), is fully functional. It features an interactive 24-fret, 6-string fretboard where users can select notes. A Clear button resets selections, and a Sound toggle button is present, though its MIDI functionality is currently mocked.

On the backend, a robust FastAPI application is in place, utilizing  for data schemas and  for its core business logic, supporting both basic and advanced chord identification. Crucially, the frontend (specifically ) has been successfully integrated with these backend APIs, replacing all previously used mock data. The  file has been removed from the codebase.

Comprehensive backend testing using  has been completed, with all tests passing successfully. The application is now fully integrated between frontend and backend for its primary chord recognition feature. The immediate next step is to initiate automated frontend testing to ensure the UI behaves as expected with the live backend data.
